Hi! This is the personal blog of me, Nikolay Sukharev (aka mrchnk).
I am a fulltime game developer. Here I would like to share my experience with technologies I use day-to-day. Since I most experienced with front-end web game development those technologies would be ActionScript Flash, JavaScript, Haxe at most. But that's not the only ones.
